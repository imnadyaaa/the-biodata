          <p>
            I am a versatile designer skilled in diverse environments, including startups,  scale-ups, and large corporations (top-tier consulting), spanning industries such as insurtech, banking, mobility, healthcare, retail, and automotive across Germany, the UK, Norwegia and Switzerland.
          </p>
          <p>
            My passion for building digital products is shaped by having the mindset of putting humans in the center of attention; to ensure the product team is solving the right problem for the people.
          </p>
          <p>
           My design process is backed-up with the iterative approach of user research, problem definition, hypotheses creations, prototyping, and testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            My strong focus is on discovery research and building design concepts that will enable organizations in defining a new strategy or product opportunities to help the business gain its competitive advantage.
